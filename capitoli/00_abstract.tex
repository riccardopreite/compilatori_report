\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present a \textbf{social aware} platform combined with \textbf{human activity recognition} \textbf{anonymization of sensitive data} of the user.
Thanks to the combination of these three principles we have built an application, with private and public aspects, for places recommendation thanks to a social sharing of places, an human activity recognizer and a place prediction model.
